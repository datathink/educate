Info we Trust: How to Inspire the World with Data reads and feels like a book for data scientists, much like the Hebrew Bible is for the Jews. I know that comparison could be a bit heretical, but let me explain myself. The book starts at the origin of language (Trust comes from Trees) and moves through the ancient depths of the sea and Beowulf&amp;rsquo;s journeys (the origins of data) to James Brown and the data of music (lived data) to frame the journey.</description></item><item><title>Learning should 'burn' a little.

He provides his learning manifesto in this post.
Learning vs. Teaching Teaching has many positive connotations and has an impactful connotation in our society.1 However, I have often observed teachers believe the myth that they have to be THE experts and that no other person in the room can be an expert. This failure in the perception of what a teacher provides in a classroom is my motivation to use the word â€˜learning.</description></item></channel></rss>

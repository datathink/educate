I like to leave my courses open-ended enough, so the students have to decide how far they will go or which elements they will learn deeply. In my senior-level classes, even the material they are &amp;lsquo;required&amp;rsquo; to read is up to them1.

Hathaway&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Teaching Philosophy&amp;rsquo; purposely titled a &amp;lsquo;Learning Manifesto&amp;rsquo; changing each word with purpose.

Learning vs. Teaching Teaching has many positive connotations and has an impactful connotation in our society.1 However, I have often observed teachers believe the myth that they have to be THE experts and that no other person in the room can be an expert. This failure in the perception of what a teacher provides in a classroom is my motivation to use the word â€˜learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
